# Starttter

A website boilerplate.

Based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (from [H5BP initializer](http://www.initializr.com/))

## Installation

1. Install [git](http://git-scm.com/), [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html)
2. Clone the project: `git@github.com:taktran/starttter.git`
3. Go into the directory and run: `npm install`
4. Install [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/)

To start the server (with [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) and [livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-livereload)):

    grunt --force

(`--force` is to make sure jshint doesn't stop the server if there is an error)
